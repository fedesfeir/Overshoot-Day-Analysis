# Overshoot Day Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory and statistical analysis of **Overshoot Day** and its relationship with socio-economic and ecological indicators such as:
- Life expectancy
- Human Development Index (HDI)
- GDP per capita
- Population
- Production
- Consumption

The goal of this analysis is to understand how development and consumption patterns influence the ecological overshoot of different countries and whether these relationships vary by income group or region.
